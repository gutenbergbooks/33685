<h5>(CONTINUED FROM P. 145.)</h5>

<h3>No. IX.&mdash;UNDER THE HARROW.</h3>

<h4><i>A Conventional Comedy-Melodrama, in Two Acts.</i></h4>

<p>ACT. II.&mdash;<span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>Same as in Act I.; viz., the Morning-room at
Natterjack Hall. Evening of same day. Enter</i> <span class="sc">Blethers</span>.</p>

<p><i>Blethers.</i> Another of Sir <span class="sc">Poshbury's</span> birthdays almost gone&mdash;and
my secret still untold! (<i>Dodders.</i>) I can't keep it up much longer
... Ha, here comes his Lordship&mdash;he does look mortal bad, that he
do! Miss <span class="sc">Verbena</span> ain't treated him too well, from all I can hear,
poor young feller!</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> Lord <span class="sc">Bleshugh</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lord Bleshugh.</i> <span class="sc">Blethers</span>, by the memory of the innumerable
half-crowns that have passed between us, be my friend now! I
have no others left. Persuade your young Mistress to come hither&mdash;you
need not tell her <i>I</i> am here, you understand. Be discreet, and
this florin shall be yours!</p>

<p><i>Blethers.</i> Leave it to me, my Lord. I'd tell a lie for less than
that, any day, old as I am!</p>
<p class="author1">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Lord Bl.</i> I cannot rest till I have heard from her own lips that
the past few hours have been nothing but a horrible dream ...
She is coming! Now for the truth!</p>
<blockquote><p>[<i>Enter</i> <span class="sc">Verbena</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Verbena.</i> Papa, did you want me? (<i>Recognises
Lord B.&mdash;controls herself to a cold formality.</i>)
My Lord, to what do I owe this&mdash;this
unexpected intrusion?</p>
<blockquote><p>[<i>Pants violently.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lord Bl.</i> <span class="sc">Verbena</span>, tell me, you cannot really
prefer that seedy snob in the burst boots to me?</p>

<p><i>Verb. (aside).</i> How can I tell him the truth
without betraying dear Papa? No, I must lie,
though it kills me. (<i>To</i> Lord B.) Lord <span class="sc">Bleshugh</span>,
I have been trifling with you. I&mdash;I never
loved you.</p>

<p><i>Lord B.</i> I see, and all the while your heart
was given to a howling cad?</p>

<p><i>Verb.</i> And if it was, who can account for the
vagaries of a girlish fancy! We women are
capricious beings, you know. (<i>With hysterical
gaiety.</i>) But you are unjust to Mr. <span class="sc">Spiker</span>&mdash;he
has not <i>yet</i> howled in my presence&mdash;(aside)&mdash;though
I very nearly did in <i>his</i>!</p>

<p><i>Lord B.</i> And you really love him?</p>

<p><i>Verb.</i> I&mdash;I love him. (<i>Aside.</i>) My heart will
break!</p>

<p><i>Lord B.</i> Then I have no more to say. Farewell,
<span class="sc">Verbena</span>! Be as happy as the knowledge that you have
wrecked one of the brightest careers, and soured one of the sweetest
natures in the county, will permit. (<i>Goes up stage, and returns.</i>)
A few days since you presented me with a cloth pen-wiper, in the
shape of a dog of unknown breed. If you will kindly wait here
for half-an-hour, I shall have much pleasure in returning a memento
which I have no longer the right to retain, and there are several
little things I gave you which I can take back with me at the same
time, if you will have them put up in readiness.</p>
<p class="author1">[<i>Exit.</i></p>

<p><i>Verbena.</i> Oh, he is cruel, cruel! but I shall keep the little bone
yard-measure, and the diamond pig&mdash;they are all I have to remind
me of him!</p>
<blockquote><p>[<i>Enter</i> <span class="sc">Spiker</span>, <i>slightly intoxicated</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Spiker (throwing himself on sofa without seeing</i> <span class="sc">Verb</span>.) I don'
know how it is, but I feel precioush shleepy, somehow. P'raps I
did partake lil' too freely of Sir <span class="sc">Poshbury's</span> gen'rous Burgundy.
Wunner why they call it "gen'rous"&mdash;it didn't give <i>me</i> anything
'cept a bloomin' headache! However, I punished it, and old
<span class="sc">Poshbury</span> had to look on and let me. He-he! (<i>Examining his hand.</i>)
Who'd think, to look at thish thumb, that there was a real live
Baronet squirmin' under it. But there ish!</p>
<p class="author1">[<i>Snores.</i></p>

<p><i>Verb. (bitterly).</i> And <i>that</i> thing is my affianced husband! Ah,
no, I cannot go through with it, he is <i>too</i> repulsive! If I could but
find a way to free myself without compromising poor Papa. The
sofa-cushion! Dare I? It would be quite painless ... Surely the
removal of such an odious wretch cannot be <i>Murder</i> ... I will!
(<i>Slow music. She gets a cushion, and presses it tightly over</i>
<span class="sc">Spiker's</span>
<i>head</i>.) Oh, I wish he wouldn't gurgle like that, and how he does
kick! he cannot even die like a gentleman! (<span class="sc">Spiker's</span> <i>kicks become
more and more feeble, and eventually cease</i>.) How still he lies! I
almost wish ... Mr. <span class="sc">Spiker</span>, Mr. <span class="sc">Spi-ker</span>!... no answer&mdash;oh, I
really <i>have</i> suffocated him! (<i>Enter</i> Sir <span class="sc">Posh</span>.) You, Papa?</p>

<p><i>Sir Posh.</i> What, <span class="sc">Verbena</span>, sitting with, hem&mdash;<span class="sc">Samuel</span> in
the
gloaming? (<i>Sings, with forced hilarity.</i>) "In the gloaming, oh,
my darling!" that's as it should be&mdash;quite as it should be!</p>

<p><i>Verb. (in dull strained accents).</i> Don't sing, Papa, I cannot bear
it&mdash;just yet. I have just suffocated Mr. <span class="sc">Spiker</span> with a sofa-cushion.
See!</p>
<blockquote><p>[<i>Shows the body.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sir Posh.</i> Then I am safe&mdash;he will tell no tales now! But, my
child, are you aware of the very serious nature of your act? An act
of which, as a Justice of the Peace, I am bound to take some official
cognizance!</p>

<p><i>Verb.</i> Do not scold me, Papa. Was it not done for <i>your</i> sake?</p>

<p><i>Sir P.</i> I cannot accept such an excuse as that. I fear your
motives were less disinterested than you would have me believe.
And now, <span class="sc">Verbena</span>, what will <i>you</i> do? As your father, I would
gladly screen you&mdash;but, as a Magistrate, I cannot promise to be more
than passive.</p>

<p><i>Verb.</i> Listen, Papa. I have thought of a plan&mdash;why should I
not wheel this sofa to the head of the front-door steps, and tip it
over? They will only think he fell down when intoxicated&mdash;for he
<i>had</i> taken far too much wine, Papa!</p>

<p><i>Sir P.</i> Always the same quick-witted little fairy! Go, my child,
but be careful that none of the servants see you. (<span class="sc">Verb.</span> <i>wheels the
sofa and</i> <span class="sc">Spiker's</span> <i>body out,</i> <span class="sc">L.U.E.</span>) My poor
impulsive darling, I do hope she will not be seen&mdash;servants do make such mischief! But
there's an end of <span class="sc">Spiker</span>, at any rate. I should <i>not</i> have liked
him for a son-in-law, and with him, goes the only person who knows my unhappy secret!</p>

<p><i>Enter</i> <span class="sc">Blethers</span>.</p>

<p><i>Blethers.</i> Sir <span class="sc">Poshbury</span>, I have a secret to reveal which I can
preserve no longer&mdash;it concerns something that happened many
years ago&mdash;it is connected with your <i>birthday</i>, Sir <span class="sc">Poshbury</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sir P. (quailing).</i> What, <i>another</i>! I must stop <i>his</i> tongue at
all hazards. Ha, the rotten sash-line! (<i>To</i> <span class="sc">Bl.</span>)
I will hear you, but first close yonder window,
the night air is growing chill.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<span class="sc">Blethers</span> <i>goes to window at back. Slow
music. As he approaches it,</i> <span class="sc">Lord Bleshugh</span>
<i>enters</i> (<span class="sc">R</span> 2 <span class="sc">E</span>), <i>and, with a smothered cry of
horror, drags him back by the coat-tails&mdash;just
before the window falls with a tremendous
crash</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Sir P.</i> <span class="sc">Bleshugh</span>! What have you done?</p>

<p><i>Lord Blesh. (sternly).</i> Saved <i>him</i> from an untimely
end&mdash;and <i>you</i> from&mdash;crime.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Collapse of</i> Sir P. <i>Enter</i> <span class="sc">Verbena</span>, <i>terrified.</i></p></blockquote>
<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;"><a href="images/193-560.png"><img src="images/193-380.png" width="380" height="465" alt="'I might have broken my neck!'" /></a></div>
<p><i>Verb.</i> Papa, Papa, hide me! The night-air and
the cold stone steps have restored <span class="sc">Mr. Spiker</span> to
life and consciousness! He is coming to denounce
me&mdash;you&mdash;both of us! He is awfully annoyed!</p>

<p><i>Sir P. (recklessly).</i> It is useless to appeal to
me, child. I have enough to do to look after
myself&mdash;now!</p>
<blockquote><p>[<i>Enter</i> <span class="sc">Spiker</span>, <i>indignant</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Spiker.</i> Pretty treatment for a gentleman, this!
Look here, <span class="sc">Poshbury</span>, this young lady has
choked me with a cushion, and then pitched me
down the front steps&mdash;I might have broken my neck!</p>

<p><i>Sir P.</i> It was an oversight which I lament, but for which I must
decline to be answerable. You must settle your differences with her.</p>

<p><i>Spiker.</i> And you, too, old horse! <i>You</i> had a hand in this, I know,
and I'll pay you out for it now. My life ain't safe if I marry a
girl like that, so I've made up my mind to split, and be done with it!</p>

<p><i>Sir P. (contemptuously).</i> If you don't, <span class="sc">Blethers</span> <i>will</i>. So
do your worst, you hound!</p>

<p><i>Spiker.</i> Very well, then; I will. (<i>To the rest.</i>) I denounce this
man for travelling with a half-ticket from Edgware Road to Baker
Street on his thirteenth birthday, the 31st of March, twenty-seven
years ago this very day. &nbsp;&nbsp;[<i>Sensation.</i></p>

<p><i>Blethers.</i> Hear me; it was <i>not</i> his thirteenth birthday! Sir
<span class="sc">Poshbury's</span> birthday falls on the 1st of April&mdash;<i>to-morrow!</i> I was
sent to register the birth, and, by a blunder, which I have repented
bitterly ever since, unfortunately gave the wrong date. Till this
moment I have never had the manliness or sincerity to confess my
error, for fear of losing my situation.</p>

<p><i>Sir P. (to</i> <span class="sc">Spiker</span>). Do you hear, you paltry knave? I was
<i>not</i> thirteen. Consequently, I was under age, and the Bye-laws are still
unbroken. Your hold over me is gone&mdash;gone for ever!</p>

<p><i>Spiker.</i> H'm&mdash;<span class="sc">Spiker</span> spiked this time!</p>
<blockquote><p>[<i>Retires up
disconcerted.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>Lord Bl.</i> And you did not really love him, after all, <span class="sc">Verbena</span>?</p>

<p><i>Verb. (with arch pride).</i> Have I not proved my indifference?</p>

<p><i>Lord Bl.</i> But I forget&mdash;you admitted that you were but trifling
with my affection&mdash;take back your pin-cushion.</p>

<p><i>Verb.</i> Keep it. All that I did was done to spare my father!</p>

<p><i>Sir Posh.</i> Who, as a matter of fact, was innocent&mdash;but I forgive
you, child, for your unworthy suspicions. <span class="sc">Bleshugh</span>, my boy,
you have saved me from unnecessarily depriving myself of the
services of an old retainer. <span class="sc">Blethers</span>, I condone a dissimulation
for which you have done much to atone. <span class="sc">Spiker</span>, you vile and
miserable rascal, be off, and be thankful that I have sufficient
magnanimity to refrain from giving you in charge. (<span class="sc">Spiker</span> <i>sneaks
off, crushed</i>.) And now, my children, and my faithful old servant,
congratulate me that I am no longer&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Verbena and Lord Bleshugh (together).</i> Under the Harrow!</p>

is full of his best quality. The presidential key-note thus struck,

the present show there is certainly a preponderance of landscapes.

who assist in that excellent <i>Daily Telegraph</i> salad, "London Day
by Day," without which, served fresh and fresh every morning, life
would not be worth living, said, last Tuesday, that "the latest on
'Change is that <span class="sc">Stanley</span> declares he never saw <span class="sc">Emin Pasha</span>. Why?
Because there's no M in Pasha." <i>Mr. Punch</i>, December 21, 1889,
originated it in this form:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sc">A Mythical Person: Emin Pasha.</span>&mdash;Why this fuss about a man
who does not exist? There's no <i>M in</i> "Pasha."</p>

<p>"It's of no consequence;" only, given as the latest quotation on
'Change, was not quite up to date for "London Day by Day."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Lady Maidstone</span> announces "an 8&middot;30 o'clock" (to adapt
the Whistlerian title when he did his "ten-and-sixpenny
o'clock") at the Westminster Town Hall, for April 26,
for the production of an entirely new play, entitled
<i>Anne Tigony</i>, by a new and original dramatic authoress
of the name of <span class="sc">Sophie Klees</span>. It is, we understand, a
domestic drama illustrative of Greek life. The great
sensation scene is of course "when Greek meets Greek."
This tragedy, we are informed, "refers to what, in the
Greek way of thinking, are the sacred rites of the dead,
and the solemn importance of burial." It is, therefore, an
Anti-Cremation Society drama. The <i>tableaux</i> are by
Mrs. <span class="sc">Jopling</span>, the conductor is Mr. <span class="sc">Barney</span>, and the
leading <i>rôle</i> of <i>Anne Tigony</i> herself is to be played by
my Lady <span class="sc">Maidstone</span>. We wish <span class="sc">Sophie Klees</span> every
possible success, and a big and glorious future. Beware
the Cremationists!&mdash;they might try to wreck the piece.</p>

<h2>THE TIPPLER'S TRIUMPH.</h2>

<h4>(<i>See Mr. Goschen's Budget Speech.</i>)</h4>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p><span class="sc">Alas!</span> we deemed him purposeless; the vinous smile that flickered up</p>
<p class="i2">Across his glowing countenance was meaningless to us.</p>
<p>We only saw a drunkard who addressed us, as he liquored up,</p>
<p class="i2">Not always too politely, and in words that sounded thus.</p>
<p>"All ri' you needn' 'shult me, I'm a berrer man than you;</p>
<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Goschen</span> couldn' shpare me as a shource of revenue."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And when we led him home at night we scorned the foolish antic all</p>
<p class="i2">That flung him into gutters, made him friendly with a post;</p>
<p>And we snubbed him when he told us&mdash;we were always too pedantical&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">That he saw a thousand niggers dressed in red on buttered toast.</p>
<p>He was better, now I know it, than our soberheaded crew,</p>
<p>We who added not a farthing to the country's revenue.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>And, oh, the folly of his wife, I scarcely can imagine it,</p>
<p class="i2">When to his room he reeled at last and went to bed in boots.</p>
<p>And she, with all the bearing of a Tudor or Plantagenet,</p>
<p class="i2">Said royally, "We loathe you; you're no better than the brutes."</p>
<p>Shame upon her thus to rate him, for philanthropists are few</p>
<p>Who as much relieve our burdens, or increase the revenue.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>But now we know that Surpluses will come to fill the Treasury,</p>
<p class="i2">If only, like the sea-port towns, we all keep drinking rum;</p>
<p>And he who swills unceasingly, and always without measure, he</p>
<p class="i2">Is truly patriotic, though Blue-ribbonites look glum.</p>
<p>For to him, above all others, easy temperance is due,</p>
<p>Since he cheapens tea by twopence as a source of revenue.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Then here's to those who toasted well the national prosperity,</p>
<p class="i2">And swelled the Surplus, draining whiskey, brandy, gin, or beer;</p>
<p>And the man who owns a bottle-nose he owns a badge of merit; he</p>
<p class="i2">Takes <i>Bardolph</i>, and not <span class="sc">Randolph</span>, as a patron to revere.</p>
<p>Here's your health, my gallant Tippler, may you ne'er have cause to rue</p>
<p>That you blessed our common country as a source of revenue!</p>

<h2>THE LAW AND THE LIVER.</h2>

<blockquote><p>
[Two Magistrates have decided that selling coffee "containing 80 per cent.
of chicory" is not punishable under the Adulteration Act.]
</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="sc">Ever</span> since drinking my morning cup of what my grocer humorously
describes as "French Coffee," I have suffered from headache,
vertigo, and uncontrollable dyspepsia. I wonder what can be
the cause?</p>

<p>Perhaps the fact (inscribed on the bottom of the tin in very small
letters) that "this is a mixture of coffee and chicory," has something
to do with it.</p>

<p>Only as the chicory is in a majority of four to one, would it not
be more correct to describe it as "a mixture of chicory and coffee?"</p>

<p>I see that, in accordance with the Adulteration Act, my baker now
sells bread which he labels as "a compound of wheat and other
ingredients." Other disagreedients, he ought to say.</p>

<p>"Partly composed of fresh fruit," is the inscription on the jam I
purchase. This means one raspberry to a pound of mashed mangold-wurzel.</p>

<p>We shall be taking chemically-coloured chopped hay at five this
afternoon. Will you join us?</p>

<p>If I purchase my own coffee-beans and grind them, can my
breakfast be properly termed a bean-feast?</p>

<p>Yes, as you say, I can no doubt guard against adulteration by
keeping a couple of cows in my cellar, growing corn in my backyard,
tea-plants and sugar-canes on my roof, and devoting my best
bed-room to the cultivation of coffee, fruit, and mixed pickles; but
would my landlord approve of the system?</p>

<p>And, finally, is this what they mean by a "Free Breakfast Table,"
that every grocer is "free" to poison us under cover of a badly-drawn
Act of Parliament?</p>

<h2>OLD TIMES REVIVED.</h2>

<blockquote><p>
"<span class="sc">Returning to Old Times.</span>&mdash;The new coaches, which are to carry the parcel mail
between Manchester and Liverpool nightly, ran for the first time tonight. The coach
from Manchester for Liverpool started punctually at ten o'clock from the Parcel Office, in
Stevens Square. Some thousands of people had assembled to witness the inauguration of
the service. The van, which has been specially constructed for the service, was well-filled
with parcels, and a guard in uniform, an old soldier, took his seat inside it, armed with a
six-shooter and a side-sword. The departure of the coach, which was announced by the
blowing of a horn, was loudly cheered by the crowd of people, and the vehicle was
followed down the main streets of the city by some hundreds of spectators. There are
three horses to the van, and relays of horses are provided at Hollins Green and Prescot.
The coaches are timed to do the thirty-six mile journey in five and a half hours, arriving
in Manchester and Liverpool respectively at 3.15 <span class="sc">A.M.</span>"&mdash;<i>Daily Paper, April 14, 1890.</i>

all be provided for. Not one of you fine fellows will ever have to seek refuge
in the workhouse!' Now, you perhaps know how that promise has been

<h2>IN THE KNOW.</h2>

<h4>(<i>By Mr. Punch's Own Prophet.</i>)</h4>

<p><span class="sc">There</span> was some good racing at
Newmarket last week, and, as usual,
every single race proved up to the hilt
the extraordinary accuracy of my forecasts.
I said a year ago that "<i>Bandersnatch</i>
was a colt who hadn't a
chance of winning a first-class race.
Only a March hare or a Bank-holiday
boozer would think of backing him."
<i>Bandersnatch's name never even appeared
on the race-card last week.</i> Mr.
<span class="sc">Jeremy</span> says the colt is dead, as if that
had anything to do with it; but of
course if the gullish herd chooses to
cackle after Mr. <span class="sc">Jeremy</span> it's no use
trying to help them.</p>

<p>The hippopotamus-headed dolts who
pinned their faith to <i>Molly Mustard</i>
must have learnt their lesson by this
time. Of course <i>Molly Mustard</i> defeated
that overrated sham <i>Undercut</i>;
but what of that? When <i>Undercut</i>
was placed second to <i>Pandriver</i> at the
North Country Second Autumn Handicap
two years ago, I warned everybody
that <i>Wobbling Willie</i> who is half-brother
to <i>Rattlepate</i> by <i>Spring Onion</i>,
ought to have made a certainty of the
race if the gruel-brained idiots who
own him had only rubbed his back
with <span class="sc">Daffy's</span> Elixir twice a-day before
going to bed. As it was <i>Wobbling
Willie</i> rolled about like a ship at sea,
and Brighton Pref passed him in a
common canter. That scarcely made
<i>Molly Mustard</i> a second <i>Eclipse</i>. The
fact of the matter is she is a roarer, or
will be before the season is over, and
those who backed her will have to
whistle for their money. All I can say
is, that I hope they will like the trap
into which their own patent-leather-headed
imbecility has led them.</p>

<p><i>Corncrake</i> is a nice, compact, long-coupled,
raking-looking colt, with a fine
high action that reminds me of a steam-pump
at its best. He is not likely to
bring back much of the £3000 given
for him as a yearling by his present
owner, but he might be used to make
the running for his stable-companion
<i>Catsmeat</i>, who was picked up for £5
out of a butcher's cart at Doncaster.</p>

<p>For the Two Thousand I should have
selected <i>Barkis</i> if he had been entered.
Failing him, there is very little in it.
<i>Sandy Sal</i> might possibly have a
chance, but she has always turned out
such an arrant rogue that I hesitate
to recommend her. Mr. <span class="sc">Jeremy</span> plumps
for <i>Old Tom</i>, and the whole pack of
brainless moon-calves goes after him in
full cry as usual. If <i>Old Tom</i> had two
sound legs he might be a decent horse,
but he has only got one, and he has
never used that properly.</p>

most interesting ocashun all their fond Mas and their stump-upping
Pas sent them into the famous Egipshun All in such a warious combenashun
of hartistick loveliness and buty as ewen I myself never
seed ekalled! Whether it was the rayther
sewere coldness of the heavening, or the niceness
of the seweral refreshments as the kind
Lady Maress perwided, or whether it was that
most on 'em was amost one year older than they
was larst year, in course I don't know, but they
suttenly kept on a pitching into the wittels and
drink in a way as rayther estonished ewen my
seasoned eyes, acustomed as they is to Copperashun

bewty of a Faery, with her lovely silwer wand
of power, amost friten'd me out of my wits
by thretening to turn me into sumthink dredful
if I didn't give her a strawbery hice emedeately,
which she fust partly heated, and
then drunk, as their custom is, I spose. Then
there was a lot of all sorts&mdash;niggers and sodgers,
and three young ladies as mag-pies. Which last made me think
that a young gent fond of using his fists might do wus than go as a
burd prize-fiter. By the way, one likes condesenshun, down to a
certain xtent, but whether it should hinclude a most bewtifool
Princess a dansing with a pore littel white-faced Clown, is what I
must leave others to deside; I declines doing it myself.</p>

<p>We had <i>Mr. Punch</i> in the course of the heavening, and both hold and
young larfed away as ushal at his rayther rum morality. Then we
had two most clever gents who dressed theirselves up before a large
looking-glass to look like lots of diffrent peeple. The best couple I
was told was two Gents named <span class="sc">Bizmarck</span> and <span class="sc">Bullanger</span>, one was
said to be a reel Ero, and the other, a mere Sham, but I don't know
werry much about such Gents myself, xcept that <span class="sc">Brown</span> tried werry
hard to make me beleeve that <span class="sc">Bizmarck</span>, who was the reel Ero, used
to think nothink of pouring a hole Bottle of Shampain into a hole Pot
of Stout and drinking it all off at one draft, like a ancient Cole
Heaver! We finished up with a lot of German Chinese, who jumped
about and danced about and climbed up a top of one another, and then
acshally bilt theirselves up like a house, and then all tumbled to
pieces, reelly quite wunderfool, and not only the lovely little children,
but ewen Common Councilmen, aye and ewen ancient Deputys, all
stood round and larfed away and enjoyed theirselves, recalling to my
sumwhat faltering memory the words of the emortel Poet, "One touch,

the end of the Second Act filling the
house with a mixture one-tenth smoke
to nine-tenths enthusiasm. By the
time these lines are before the entire
world, if all goes well, <i>Thorgrim</i>, by
Mr. <span class="sc">Frederick Cowen</span>, will have been produced. As the work of a
native composer, it should receive a hearty welcome, particularly on
the boards of the National Theatre; but, sink or swim, the Carl
Rosa Opera Company cannot possibly come to harm with its present
popular <i>repertoire</i>. And, as good music is a boon to the London
public, such a state of things is distinctly satisfactory.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/double_rule-1.png" width="250" height="10" alt="double-rule" border="0" /></div>

<p>"<span class="sc">In the Name of the Law!</span>"&mdash;It is a pity that Mr. <span class="sc">Law</span>, the
author of <i>Dick Venables</i>, did not take a little more trouble in the
construction of his new piece at the Shaftesbury Theatre. It just
misses being an excellent drama, and deserving the valuable
assistance it receives from all concerned on the stage side of
the Curtain. That the wife of a convict should take a house next
door to her deeply dreaded husband's prison, that a jewel-collector
should keep his precious stones in a side-board, that an Archdeacon
should apparently have nothing better to do than play the kleptomaniac
at Dartmoor, are facts that seem largely improbable; and
yet these are the salient points of the latest addition to the playgoer's
<i>repertoire</i>. For the rest, <i>Dick Venables</i> is interesting, and
admirably played. But whether, after the first-night criticisms, the
piece will do, is a question that must be left to the future for solution.</p>

<h3>HYPNOTIC HIGH FEEDING.</h3>

<p>(<i>Being some Brief Diary Notes of a Coming Little Dinner (New Style),
jotted down a few years hence.</i>)</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Your</span> dinner is served. Sir!"</p>

<p>It was the Professorial Butler who made this announcement with
a solemn and significant bow. He had undertaken, for the modest
fee of half-a-crown, to throw my four guests,&mdash;an Epicurean Duke,
a couple of noted Diners-out, and a Gourmand of a high order well
known in Society,&mdash;into a profound hypnotic sleep, under the influence
of which, while supplied with a few scraps of food, and slops by
way of drink, they were to believe that they were assisting at a most
<i>recherché</i> repast, provided by a <i>cuisine</i>, and accompanied by choice
vintage wines, both of the first excellence.</p>

<p>I felt a little nervous as we proceeded to the dining-room, but as
the Professor adroitly passed his hand over the head of each as he
descended the stairs, and pointed out to me the dazed and vacant
look that had settled on the features of all of them, I felt
reassured, especially when they fell mechanically into their places,
and began to peruse, with evident
delight, the contents of the <i>Menu</i>,
which ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<table width="60%" align="center" summary="menu" border="0">
<tr><td>
<h4><span class="sc">Soup.</span></h4>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: -1em;">Toast-and-water and Candle-ends.</p>

<h4><span class="sc">Fish.</span></h4>
<p class="center" style="margin-top: -1em;">Herrings' Heads and Tails.<br />
Counter Sweepings.</p>

<h4><span class="sc">Entremets.</span></h4>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: -1em;">Rotten Cabbage-stalks.</p>

<h4><span class="sc">Entrée.</span></h4>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: -1em;">Odds and Ends of Shoe Leather.</p>

<h4><span class="sc">Roast.</span></h4>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: -1em;">Cat's Meat.</p>

<h4><span class="sc">Sweet.</span></h4>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: -1em;">Old Jam-pot Scrapings on Musty Bread.</p>
</td></tr>
  </table>

<p>That they didn't all rise like one
man with a howl of execration on
reading this was soon explained
when the Professorial Butler set
down a soup-plate before the Epicurean
Duke and with an insinuating
smile, simply announced it as
<i>Tortue claire</i>. It was clear from
this that they were under the impression
that they were partaking
of a first-class little dinner, and had
read the <i>Menu</i> at the will of the
Professorial Butler, as he subsequently
explained to me in such
fashion that the toast-and-water
soup, in which the candle-ends
played the part of green fat, appeared
to them in the light of the
finest "clear turtle." "And how
about the Herrings' Heads and
Tails?" I asked. "They take that
for <i>Saumon de Gloucester, sauce
Pierre Le Grand</i>," was the bland reply, a fact which at that moment
the Gourmand endorsed, by smacking his lips and with an ejaculation
of "Sublime salmon that! I'll take a little more," holding out
his plate for a second helping. The Cabbage-stalks figured in their
imagination as "<i>Asperges d'Italie, en branches glacées à la Tour
d'Amsterdam</i>,"
while the pennyworth of plain cat's meat, passed more
than muster as "<i>Filet de B&oelig;uf en Diplomat, braisée à la Prince de
Pékin</i>." The Shoe-leather and Jam-pot Scrapings brought the Menu
to a triumphant close, with "<i>Ris de Veau pralinée au boucles
Menschikoff</i>,"
and "<i>Bombardes Impérials de Péru</i>" respectively.</p>

<p>I confess, when I heard one of the Diners-out asking for Champagne,
and saw his glass filled with Harvey's Sauce and water, with
the announcement that it was <i>Dry Monopole Cuvée Réservée</i>, I felt
some momentary misgivings, but they were speedily put to flight on
my noticing the evident gusto with which he emptied his glass,
at the same time pronouncing it to be "a very fine wine," which he
assigned to the vintage of '76. I own too I felt a little nervous when
the Professorial Butler, I think not without a sly twinkle in his eye,
gave all the party a <i>liqueur</i> of petroleum for Green Chartreuse, but
they certainly seemed to find it all right, and so my apprehensions
disappeared.</p>

<p>Thus my "Little Dinner" came at length to a conclusion. That
it was an undoubted success, from a financial point of view, there
can be no sort of doubt, for fourpence more than covered the cost of
the materials, to which, adding the Professorial Butler's fee of two
shillings and sixpence, brings the whole cost of the entertainment up
to eightpence-halfpenny a head. It is true I have not heard whether
any of my guests have suffered any ill-effects from partaking of my
hospitality, but I suppose if any of them had died or been seized with
violent symptoms, the fact would have been notified to me. So, on the
whole, I may congratulate myself. I certainly could not afford to entertain
largely in any other fashion, but, with the aid of the Professorial
Butler, I am already contemplating giving a series of nice "Little
Dinners," and even on a more extended scale. Indeed, with the
assistance of Hypnotism, it is possible, at a trifling cost, to see one's
friends. And in the general interests of Society, I mean to do it.</p>

<h3>BULLYING POOR "BULLY."</h3>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p><span class="sc">Says</span> the Blackbird to the Bullfinch, "It is April; let us up!</p>
<p>We will breakfast on the plum-germs, on the pear-buds we will sup."</p>
<p>Says the Bullfinch to the Blackbird, "We'll devour them every bit,</p>
<p>And quite ruin the fruit-growers, with some aid from the Tom-tit."</p>
<p>Then these garden Machiavellis set to work and did not stop</p>
<p>Till the promise of September prematurely plumped each crop.</p>
<p>Ah! the early frost is ruthless, and the caterpillar's cruel,</p>
<p>But, to spifflicate the plum or give the gooseberry its gruel,</p>
<p>To confusticate the apple, or to scrumplicate the pear,</p>
<p>Discombobulate the cherry, make the grower tear his hair,</p>
<p>And in general play old gooseberry with the orchard and the garden,</p>
<p>Till the Autumn crop won't fetch the grumpy farmer "a brass farden,"</p>
<p>There is nothing half so ogreish as the Bullfinch and his chums,</p>
<p>Those imps of devastation&mdash;as regards our pears and plums.</p>
<p>Poor "Bully," sung by <span class="sc">Cowper</span> in his pretty plaintive verse,</p>
<p>It is thus thine ancient character they (let us hope) asperse.</p>
<p>"The gardener's chief enemy," so angry scribes declare,</p>
<p>And the cause why ribstone pippins and prime biggaroons are rare.</p>
<p>Little birds, my pretty "Bully," should all diet upon worms,</p>
<p>And grub on grubs, contented, not on fruit-buds and young germs</p>
<p>Vain your pretty coat, my "Bully," beady eyes, and pleasant pipe,</p>
<p>If you will not give our fruit-crops half a chance of getting ripe.</p>
<p>Let us hope that they traduce you, all this angry scribbling host</p>
<p>Of horticultural zealots who abuse you in the <i>Post</i>.</p>
<p>The Reverend <span class="sc">F. O. Morris</span> takes the field in your defence,</p>
<p>But they swear, though picturesquish, he's devoid of common-sense.</p>
<p><i>Punch</i> inclineth to the Parson, and he doesn't quite believe</p>
<p>All the statements of the growers and the gardeners who grieve</p>
<p>Over "Bully's" depredations, for he knows that, as a rule,</p>
<p>The birds' foe is a fashionable fribble, or a fool.</p>
<p>From the damsels who despoil them for their bonnets or their cloaks,</p>
<p>To the farmer who exterminates the dickies, and then croaks</p>
<p>O'er the spread of caterpillars and such-like devouring vermin,</p>
<p>They are selfish and shortsighted. So he'll not in haste determine</p>
<p>The case against poor "Bully," or the Blackbird, or Tom-tit.</p>
<p>Though they put it very strongly, <i>Punch</i> would warn them&mdash;Wait a bit!</p>

<p><span class="sc">Sportive Captain Hawley Smart</span> takes a somewhat new departure
in <i>Without Love or Licence</i>. There is less racing than usual
in this novel, and there is a very ingenious plot, which we are not
going to spoil the pleasure of the reader by divulging. The secret
is well kept, and one is put off the scent till well-nigh the final
chapter. The whole story is bright and dashing, abounding with
graphic sketches of such people as one meets every day. The author
is in the best of spirits&mdash;he evidently has a licence for spirits&mdash;and
keeps his audience thoroughly amused, from start to finish.</p>

<h3>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h3>

<p><i>Joints in our Social Armour</i>, by a Mr.
<span class="sc">James Runciman</span>, has an amusing "Dedication
to W. S. and G. N. S." "Gentlemen,"
writes this seemingly new member of the
brotherhood of letters, "this little book contains
many things which have already pleased
you, and all that may be good in them has
really come from you." After this frank
confession, one naturally desires to have the
"good things" of "W. S. and G. N. S."
first-hand, instead of what presumably must
be a <i>rechauffé</i>. As the "good things,"
however, have to be picked out of a volume
of 342 pages of wearisome reading about
"The Ethics of the Drink Question," "The
Social Influence of the 'Bar'" (Public-house,
<i>bien entendu</i>), "Genius and Respectability,"
&amp;c., &amp;c., it is not an easy task to find them.
For the rest, to the intelligent reader, the
joints of Messrs. W. S., G. N. S., and <span class="sc">James
Runciman</span> are likely to prove veritable pieces
de résistance. A cut from the joint in this
instance is accordingly strongly recommended.</p>

<h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

<h3>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h3>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, April 14.</i>&mdash;Boys came back after
Easter Monday; Head Master punctually in his place.</p>

<p>"Yes, dear <span class="sc">Toby</span>," he said, as I respectfully shook his hand. "I
am nothing if not a man of business. Done my duty to the country
round Henley; now come up to do my duty in town at Westminster."</p>

<p>Not all the boys here. Some, including Oldest Boy, extending their
holiday. Prince <span class="sc">Arthur</span> not turned up yet, nor <span class="sc">Grandolph</span>, nor
<span class="sc">Chamberlain</span>. Wide empty space on Front Opposition Bench where
<span class="sc">Harcourt</span> wont to sit. A dozen Members on Ministerial Benches; a
score on Opposite side; others in ambush, especially on Ministerial side.</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Akers-Douglas</span>, like <i>Roderick Dhu</i>, need only blow his horn
and the glen is filled with armed men," said Colonel <span class="sc">Malcolm</span>, who
knows his Walter Scott by heart. The <span class="sc">Douglas</span> being a man of modern
ideas, doesn't blow his horn: would be unparliamentary; might lead
to his being named and relegated to the Clock Tower. Effect brought
about when bell rings for Division; then Members troop in in fifties.
"What's the Question?" they ask each other, as they stand at Bar.
Nobody quite sure. Some say it's wages of Envoy Extraordinary at
Buenos Ayres; others affirm it's salary of Chaplain of Embassy in
Vienna. A third believes it's something to do with the Nyassa
region; a fourth is sure it's Turks in Armenia; whilst Member who
has heard portion of one of several speeches delivered by <span class="sc">Sage of
Queen Anne's Gate</span>, says it's Motion made to provide a Chaplain for
<span class="sc">Drummond Wolff</span>, whose forlorn condition, planted out amid
Mahommedans in Teheran, <span class="sc">Sage</span> has been lamenting. Few quite
sure of actual question; fewer still heard it debated. But no time to
lose. House cleared for Division. Must go in one Lobby or other; so
Ministerialists follow each other like sheep; Opposition flock into other
Lobby. Amendment (whatever it is) negatived by 134 Votes against 69.</p>

<p>In conversation about Vienna Chaplaincy <span class="sc">Winterbotham</span> comes
to front. "Why," he asks, "should we support an English church
in Vienna more than in other Continental towns, where the residents
provide the funds? Not many months ago I was in the church at
Vienna; called upon to hand the plate round, and there were only a
few shillings to hand over to expectant parson."</p>

<p>"Very good story," said <span class="sc">Wilfrid Lawson</span>; "but if I was
<span class="sc">Winterbotham</span>, wouldn't tell it again. <i>What became of the money?</i>"</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Diplomatic and Consular Vote obtained.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Old Morality</span> proposes forthwith
to take morning sittings on Tuesdays
and Fridays. Private Members in state of
burning indignation. Scarcely anything left
to them but Tuesdays. On Fridays Government
business takes precedence. Notices of
Amendment may be moved on going into
Committee of Supply; but so hampered that
hardly any use as outlet for legislative
energies of private Members. On Tuesdays
have it all to themselves. May move Amendments,
take Divisions, and generally enjoy
themselves. Now <span class="sc">Old Morality</span> comes along
"Like the blind Fury, with abhorrëd shears,"
says <span class="sc">Cozens-Hardy</span>, dropping into bad language,
"and cuts us off our Toosday."</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 150px;"><a href="images/204a-330.png"><img src="images/204a-150.png" width="150" height="372" alt="Comes the blind Fury.'" /></a>
<p class="center">Comes the blind Fury."</p></div>

<p>Nothing in the world less like a blind Fury
than our dear Leader, as he sits on Treasury
Bench bearing brunt of protest from every
side. Very sorry; desirous of meeting convenience
of Hon. Members in whatever part
of House they sit. But duty has first call.
Duty to <span class="sc">Queen</span> and country demands partial
sacrifice of Tuesdays.</p>

<p>Motion carried, and this the last Tuesday
Private Members will enjoy. Must make the
most of it. <span class="sc">Compton</span> on first, with Motion
setting forth grievances of Postal Telegraph
Clerks. Excellent Debate, and Division over by eight o'clock. Still
four hours' work. <span class="sc">Mark Stewart</span> has next place. <span class="sc">Stewart</span> has
Marked necessity for Reform of Constitution in proceedings of Fiars
Courts in Scotland. Thinks functions of Fiars' Juries should be
extended. Rare opportunity for House of Commons to master this
question. True, it is dinner-time; but what is dinner compared
with the national interest smouldering under these Fiars? Besides,
it's our last Tuesday.</p>

<p>"We must make the most of this," says <span class="sc">Albert Rollit</span> to <span class="sc">Richard
Temple</span>. "Yes," says <span class="sc">Richard Temple</span>, with effusion. "Glad
you're staying on. Wouldn't do to be Counted Out to-night."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Rollit</span>, thinking he's got <span class="sc">Temple</span> all right, walks off by front
hall door; <span class="sc">Temple</span>, certain that <span class="sc">Rollit</span> will stay, executes
strategic
retreat by corridor, leading past dining-room to central hall. Same
thing going on in a hundred other cases, "Must see this through,"
One says to the Other. "By all means," the Other says to One.
Then One and the Other saunter out of the Lobby, quicken their
steps when they get into outer passage, and speed out of Palace Yard
as quick as Hansom would fly.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Mark Stewart</span> still puffing away at the Fiars; House gradually
emptying, till no one left but the <span class="sc">Lord Advocate</span> and <span class="sc">George
Campbell</span>. Presently <span class="sc">Campbell</span> strides forth. Somebody moves
that <span class="sc">Lord Advocate</span> be Counted. <span class="sc">Speaker</span> finds he's not forty.
("I'm really forty-five, you know," <span class="sc">Lord Advocate</span> pleads.) No
Quorum. So at a quarter past eight House Counted Out. "Hard on
you, <span class="sc">Stewart</span>," the <span class="sc">Lord Advocate</span> said, as the two walked
through
the deserted chamber. "Must have spent good deal of trouble on
your speech. Subject so interesting, too; pity to lose it; advise you
to have it printed in leaflet form, and distributed. So in your
ashes would live your wonted Fiars, as was appropriately
remarked by <span class="sc">Burns</span>." <span class="sc">Stewart</span> said he would think about it.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Compton's</span> Resolution declaring position of
telegraphists
unsatisfactory negatived by 142 votes against 103.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;"Better have a nip of something short," said <span class="sc">Jackson</span>,
friendly Bottle Holder, to <span class="sc">Chancellor of the Exchequer</span>,
he too in <span class="sc">Jokim's</span> room finally revising notes for Budget Speech.</p>

<p>"No," said <span class="sc">Jokim</span>, shaking his head, and wistfully regarding the
Port decanter; "it wouldn't do. Think of what I have to say in my
speech about the drink traffic. It's drink that has created our
Surplus. Can't help the Surplus, but must say a word in condemnation
of drink. Would never do to have me enforcing my argument

'Who drinks the rum?' <span class="sc">Tanner</span> were to point to the tumbler and
shout across the House, 'You do.' Where would we be? Where
would Her Majesty's Government be? No, <span class="sc">Jackson</span>, old fellow,
you mean well, and a sip of Port, with or without an egg, in course
of three hours' speech, is a comfort. But it mustn't be;" and
<span class="sc">Jokim</span> turned resolutely away from decanter.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 195px;"><a href="images/204b-580.png"><img src="images/204b-195.png" width="195" height="300" alt="'I hear a smile pass over the face of the Right Hon. Gentleman.'" /></a>

<p class="center">I hear a smile pass over
the face of the Right Hon. Gentleman."</p></div>

<p><span class="sc">Jackson</span> kind-hearted fellow; deeply touched at his chief's heroic
self-denial. "You leave it
to me," he whispered, as they
left <span class="sc">Jokim's</span> room and strolled
off to Treasury Bench.</p>

<p>Just before <span class="sc">Jokim</span> rose to
commence Budget Speech
<span class="sc">Jackson</span> came in carrying
tumblerful of dark liquid;
might be extract of walnut,
printer's ink, anything
equally innoxious. <span class="sc">Jokim</span>
saw it, and recognised the
'51 Port.</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Jackson</span>," he whispered, tremulously,
"you shouldn't do it; but since you <i>will</i>,
leave the bottle on the chimbley-piece, and
don't ask me to take none, but let me put
my lips to it when I am so dispoged, and
then I will do what I am engaged to do
according to the best of my ability."</p>

<p>No chimbley-piece handy. So <span class="sc">Jackson</span>
cunningly tucked away the tumbler in
among the Blue Books and papers where it
innocently rested till <span class="sc">Jokim</span>, well under
way with speech, and feeling round for
notes upset it; agonised glance as the ruby
fluid ran over the unresponsive table on to
the heedless floor. Heartless persons opposite
tittered.</p>

<p>"I hear a smile pass over the face of the
Right Hon. Gentleman," said <span class="sc">Jokim</span>, fixing
glance somewhat venomously on <span class="sc">Harcourt</span>. House burst into roar
of laughter. <span class="sc">Jackson</span> took advantage of diversion to mop up spilled
Port with blotting-paper. Only <span class="sc">Grand Cross</span> in Peers' Gallery, sat
stern and unresponsive.</p>

<p>"I call that pretty mean, <span class="sc">Toby</span>," he said, talking it over afterwards.
"It was I who first saw the smile in House of Commons.
My greatest oratorical success; and here comes <span class="sc">Jokim</span>, coolly appropriates
it, and House laughs as if it were quite new!" Never saw
<span class="sc">Grand Cross</span> so terribly angry. <span class="sc">Jokim</span> will have bad quarter of
an hour when they meet. <i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Budget brought in.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Bi-metallism the matter to-night. <span class="sc">Sam Smith</span> brings on
attractive subject in one of those terse, polished, pregnant orations
for which he is famous. Nevertheless, the few Members present
yawn. <span class="sc">Old Morality</span>&mdash;"nothing if not man of business"&mdash;finds
topic irresistible. Whilst subject <i>caviare</i> to the General
(<span class="sc">Goldsworthy</span>
and others), seems matter of life and death to a select half-dozen;
these glare at each other across House, as if arguments
advanced <i>pro</i> and <i>con</i>. affected their private character. Prince
<span class="sc">Arthur</span> plunges in; declares in favour of Bi-metallism; Irish
Members share common ignorance on subject; but this settles them;
go out in body to vote for Mono-metallism; <span class="sc">Sam Smith's</span> Motion for
Conference negatived by 183 votes against 87.</p>
